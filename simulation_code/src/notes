what to do 

1- add lang long to vm and user  (cloudlet)   											done
2- use them to caculate the latency            											done
3- build fitness equations functions		   											done
4- save optimal dataset with resources parameters                  						done
5- find best datacenter based on it objective function                                 working on
6-retrain lstm-ga on the new dataset
7- test and retrieve performance metrics from the new model
8- deploy the project on server
9- build lstm-snake algorithm
10- compare the results from two models
