what to do 

1- add lang long to vm and user  (cloudlet)
2- use them to caculate the latency
3- build miss asmaa equations functions
4- build find best datacenter 
4- add delay time based in distance on simulation in addition of processing delay it is popogation delay
4- each data center one vm
5- create datasetes for the datacenters allocation hisotry
